cdifflib
========

Python difflib core parts reimplemented in C.

Actually only contains the reimplemented parts.  Creates a "CSequenceMatcher"
type which inherets most functions from difflib's SequenceMatcher.

Limitations
-----------
Can only work on 2 lists rather than generic sequences.


Making
